<P>Currently, the software provides the configuration of four preferred content. 
Here are a few important configuration items. </P>

  <LI>specifies the ffmpeg command. For streaming media using the HLS protocol, 
  after the download is complete, you need to use ffmpeg to merge, and you can 
  configure the corresponding command line here. If ffmpeg has been added to the 
  current environment, just use the default configuration. Otherwise, you need 
  to specify the path of the ffmpeg execution file, such as 
  "C:\MyTools\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe -f concat -safe 0 -i "{0}" -c copy "{1}". 
  When configuring, please set "{0}" and "{1}" correctly. The former is the 
  corresponding HLS list file, and the latter is the output media file. These 
  two parameters are automatically filled in by the system. 
  <LI>Configure the call system command and check the "Delete source files after 
  HLS merge is completed" to automatically clear the redundant HLS fragment 
  files after the merge. 
  <LI>Many sites have restrictions on the number of thread connections, so if 
  there is an error due to too many thread connections, you can set the 
  connection limit for the specified site in the bottom table. If <A 
  href="http://www.google.com" of number The>www.google.com</A> is 10, and you 
  only need to use google or google.com as the site keyword when setting it, 
  because the system will use The way the string contains is judged.

  <LI>If you feel that the system resources are too high, or the system is 
  unstable, you can cancel the configuration of "Use Chromium kernel", and you 
  can disable Chrominum after restarting, which can improve system stability. 
  <LI>Whether it is Mp4 or HLS streaming media, there are many players that can 
  be played directly. If you want to directly use the browser of this machine to 
  view the video, you can quickly enable this function by setting the "Start 
  Player Command". PotPlayer is used by default. You can specify your favorite 
  player at will. Just put the parameter "{0}" in the correct position, because 
  the system will automatically fill in the remote playback URL address here 
  before executing. </LI></OL>

<P>The management of "video" and "site" is relatively simple, so I won't explain 
it in detail. </P></BODY></HTML>
