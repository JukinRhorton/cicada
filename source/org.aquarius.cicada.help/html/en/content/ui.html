<H3>Interface description</H3>
<P>The entire interface is divided into several large sections. The top one is the operation area, namely the menu and the toolbar, and the middle is the data area, which is used to display the video information of the specified site. It should be emphasized that it can be used in the browser and You can switch between the two methods of the table at will, and the query conditions of the two are also different. The specific operation will be described in detail later. The bottom is the download, error, task and other views, which is convenient for user management. </P>
<P>When opening a site for the first time, it will generally prompt that the video list information in the site is empty, and will prompt the user whether to import from the site now. Sometimes the import will be very slow, maybe because the website has a large number of videos, the import is naturally slow; and in order to block crawlers, many websites will stipulate how long the visit will exceed the specified number of times, and the visit will be denied, so the default frequency of visiting the webpage is increased. Restrictions. But don’t worry, importing is a work done silently in the background, and every time several pieces of video information are imported, the interface will be automatically refreshed and displayed, and the operation will not be affected. Although the program uses a background thread to load web pages as much as possible, it still has a certain impact on the interface operation speed of the entire program due to the use of a browser to access it, so if possible, consider importing videos in free time. </P>

  <LI>The table is more suitable for displaying large amounts of data. Considering that the scale of general video websites is not exaggerated, all video information will be displayed in the list. Due to the use of NatTable, it takes about 3 seconds to load from the database, which is slightly slower. , The rest of the time can be operated smoothly.

  <LI>The table supports multiple selections. You can use Shift/Ctrl and other keys to make multiple selections.
  <LI>Click the header of the table to sort.
  <LI>Click the right mouse button on the title bar of the table to customize the display status of each column.
